This is a command line application I am working on in my spare time to learn C++. The application maintains the state of a connect four game between two players or a player and a computer opponent. The view is currently on the command line, where a graphical representation of the board prints out at the start of each turn. There are options to change the height and width of the board as well as play an experimental connect six game type.

I am currently working on a more intelligent computer opponent. To create a better ai two computers will repetitively compete against each other. The winner of each match will have all of their column choices incremented for the corresponding board layout. After millions of these matches, the column choices for each board scenario that resulted in more wins will represent more successful play choices. There will be iterations of these sets of matches, with each iteration using the success results from the last iteration, as well as a bit of randomness, to make column decisions. After a few iterations the ai should be intelligent enough to play competitively against capable human competitors.

The Catch unit testing framework is implemented, which uses a connect four library to function. Import the project into Qt Creator to build and run it.
